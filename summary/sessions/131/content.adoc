==== Topics Discussed

* General introductions.
* link:https://twitter.com/guyinthecape[Vatsal Patel^] talked about his learnings at his workplace and how he is currently working with different teams to understand how they are working.
	** He told us how he has been practising not asking someone to give him direct answers, but to only review his work, give him feedback and point him in the correct direction.
		*** A caveat to that is that if the person whom one asks for help is undress stress, they might just provide direct answers as they don't have the time to have an elaborate discussion, so asking correct questions is important to get exactly what one wants. The responsibility of getting the type of mentorship one wants lies on oneself and cannot be entirely offloaded on someone else.
	** He has also started not directly handing off work that he doesn't understand to someone else. He tries to understand it as much as he can and ask for help.
	** He has been trying to dig deeper into concepts and his work, to be able to understand things better.
	** He also shared a talk on link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d0wzyiikXM[Automated Testing and Profiling for Call of Duty^].
