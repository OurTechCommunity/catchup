        *** Finding an internship or a job on some level is making the right set of compromises that one is willing to live with.
        *** A person's value is generally measured in three dimensions:

* link:https://twitter.com/Aryannayakk[Aryan Nayak^] talked about his routine for solving link:https://leetcode.com[Leetcode problems^].

    ** He talked about link:https://www.rankred.com/what-hardware-software-does-spacex-use-to-power-its-rockets[the computations and issues like bitflip in Falcon 9^].
        *** These issues are solved by having multiple computers running the same calculations so that even if one or two are wrong, the majority will be right.
        *** Bitflip generally happens due to radiation in space. There are ways to prevent it, but the methods are costly, so having multiple systems perform the same task is a better solution.
