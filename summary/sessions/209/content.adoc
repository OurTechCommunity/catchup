* Social media addiction
	** Siddharth Bhatia gave some suggestions to help reduce social media usage
		*** Enable greyscale whenever you use social media
		*** Use digital wellbeing's app timers to ensure something like: 20 minutes of Instagram time in a day
		*** One common thing that some people do is just using the website of the social media instead of the app. This adds more levels of friction in accessing the app. There are also some apps that specialize in increasing friction in accessing the app.

		*** link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zizonToFXDs[Introduction to large language models^]
		*** link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sLYAQS9sWQ[How Large Language Models Work^]
	** Jaden was looking to make LLMs learn without consuming context to provide it rules and without having to have humans or software interfere in preventing the LLM to generate wrong answers.
		*** Jaden was looking to give feedback to the LLM such that it learns itself. He tried using Knowledge Graphs and providing text-based feedback (but wasn't happy about the text-based feedback, as it consumes the model's context space).
		*** This entire conversation always came back to requiring human intervention, software intervention, software/LLM verifiers (who need verifiers of their own, making it an infinite sequence) or consuming the model's context length to give it clues/rules to always generate the correct answers, if one doesn't want to re-train or fine-tune the large LLM.
