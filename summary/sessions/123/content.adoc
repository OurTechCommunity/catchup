==== Topics Discussed

* [Dheeraj] asked everyone for weighing in on his Startup VS MNC decision.
    ** He said he considered factors like mentorship, code reviews, having an actual team to work with and pay into consideration when making the decision.
    ** It was also agreed upon by everyone that going from an MNC to a StartUp is easier compared to going from a StartUp to an MNC.
    ** [Wilfred] said that he hasn't figured what tech/domain he wants to work full time on, so he prefers a startup because it's relatively easy to jump work. Now people who've taken a gist of my skills recommend him to work at an MNC because they'll groom him and he can polish his skill set.
    ** [Darshit] suggested that when it comes to learning, there are better opportunities in a StartUp but he agreed to the concerns raised by [Dheeraj] and we came to a decision to choose MNC over a StartUp.

    ** Many people weighed in with their opinions.
    ** Someone suggested the idea belongs to the person who patented it first.
    ** Eventually we concluded with a shared ownership between the partners the ratio on which needs to be discussed contextually.
