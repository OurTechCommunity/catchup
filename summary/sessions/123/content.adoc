* link:https://twitter.com/DhiruCodes[Dheeraj Lalwani^] asked everyone for weighing in on his Startup VS MNC decision.
    ** He said he considered factors like mentorship, code reviews, having an actual team to work with and pay into consideration when making the decision.
    ** It was also agreed upon by everyone that going from an MNC to a StartUp is easier compared to going from a StartUp to an MNC.
