* Nirmal asked Jaden (cybersecurity expert) about firewalls.
    ** Jaden explained concepts like data packet transfer, cyclic redundancy check (CRC), encryption, and more.

* Jaden shared a project where he discovered a critical vulnerability in a ship's system.
    ** Explained about Modbus, the communication protocol used in ships, and the vulnerability he identified.
    ** Described how he wrote a malware to demonstrate the flaw to authorities and raise awareness among the ship’s crew.
    ** Discussed the challenges of writing malware in a very limited memory environment (due to outdated ship computers), including writing in C++ and invoking the code via Java.
    ** Highlighted that Java has features (via the Unsafe class) that allow bypassing the JVM to perform arbitrary operations, even accessing the UEFI.
