==== Topics Discussed

* General introductions.
* We discussed how easy link:https://razorpay.com[Razorpay^] has made integrating their payment gateway into a website and link:https://twitter.com/furtado_jaden[Jaden Furtado^] told everyone how he found a vulnerability in a website because of some misconfiguration while integrating the Razorpay payment gateway, which allowed him to intercept requests from the client and buy the product for any price he chose.
* Scaling resources
	** We talked about link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoscaling[autoscaling^], which is a Cloud Computing technique for dynamically allocating or de-allocating computational resources depending on parameters such as memory usage, network bandwidth, etc.
	** link:https://twitter.com/omtalk[Omkar Khair^] shared his blog on link:https://0x8.in/blog/2021/12/15/flapping-autoscale[Autoscale Optimizations^].
	** link:https://www.linkedin.com/in/anilharwani[Anil Harwani^] and link:https://twitter.com/omtalk[Omkar Khair^] discussed scaling.\
	** link:https://www.linkedin.com/in/anilharwani[Anil Harwani^] modeled the network cost of a single instance of an application and illustrated how it can bring down servers. He added that a lot of companies forget to measure this and only depend on CPU utilization of servers to auto scale.
* We also talked about link:https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/apu-technology-explained[Accelerated Processing Units (APUs)^].
* link:https://www.linkedin.com/in/anilharwani[Anil Harwani^] talked about two kinds of design phases DFT (Design for Test) & DFD (Design for Debug) while designing Microprocessors.
* link:https://www.linkedin.com/in/anilharwani[Anil Harwani^] suggested everyone to dig deeper into the infrastructure and to not just think about hardware from a Software Developer's perspective while building projects.
* link:https://www.linkedin.com/in/anilharwani[Anil Harwani^] shared an article link:https://norvig.com/21-days.html[Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years^] and said that he was a firm believer of it.
* link:https://www.linkedin.com/in/anilharwani[Anil Harwani^] also shared a meme on link:https://abstrusegoose.com/249[How to Teach Yourself Programming^].
* Thinking before building
	** link:https://www.linkedin.com/in/anilharwani[Anil Harwani^] brought out the difference between building software when one is starting out and when one has grown a bit or is working in a professional environment.
		*** When starting out, one should build projects to gain experience and solve certain problems that one might be facing. Once someone has grown considerably or is working in a professional environment, they should really think before just starting to build. They should access whether the product/solution proposed is even necessary or not. He said that a lot of people today are just coming up with solutions (and that too in a hurry) and aren't thinking about the problem enough.
