* Anil Harwani shared how https://www.dpdk.org/[DPDK (Data plane development kit)] handles the networking in most mainframes.
* Anil Harwani showed us some of lesser known Linux commands
    ** https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/lscpu.1.html[lscpu] - lscpu gathers CPU architecture information sysfs, /proc/cpuinfo and any applicable architecture-specific libraries (e.g. Librtas on PowerPC).
    ** https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/w.1.html[w] - w displays information about the users currently on the machine, and their processes
    ** https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/wall.1.html[wall] -  wall displays a message, or the contents of a file, or otherwise its standard input, on the terminals of all currently logged in users.
* We got to know about https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/jumbo-frames[jumbo frames] by Anil Harwani, which makes transmission fasters as the frame size are bigger which in turn takes less time to process.
* Anil Harwani shared how a https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-AMD-Old-Chipset-WA[workaround in Linux Kernel was hurting modern AMD's performance].
* Anil Harwani showed how https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/screen-command-in-linux-with-examples/[screen command] in Linux helps him in his workflow.
    ** screen command in Linux provides the ability to launch and use multiple shell sessions from a single ssh session.
