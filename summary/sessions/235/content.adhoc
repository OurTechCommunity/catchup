Alpesh - spoke about SSL Pinning

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) pinning is a security technique used to enhance the security of mobile applications by associating a specific SSL certificate or public key with a server's domain. It helps prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks by ensuring that the app only communicates with servers that have a specific, trusted certificate or public key. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
How it works:
During application development, the app developer "pins" a specific SSL certificate (or its public key) to the server's domain. 
During runtime:
When the app establishes a secure connection with the server, it compares the server's presented certificate against the pinned certificate (or public key). 
Protection against MITM:
If the server's certificate doesn't match the pinned one, the app will not establish a secure connection, preventing a potential MITM attacker from intercepting the communication. 
Benefits:
SSL pinning significantly strengthens the security of mobile applications by adding an extra layer of verification beyond standard SSL validation, making it harder for attackers to impersonate a legitimate server. 
Types:
There are two main types of pinning: certificate pinning (pinning the entire certificate) and public key pinning (pinning only the public key). 
Best practices:
It's generally recommended to pin the public key instead of the entire certificate, as it provides a higher level of security and flexibility, according to LinkedIn and Temenos.
