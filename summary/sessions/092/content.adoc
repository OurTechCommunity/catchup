    ** It depends on the industry, company and how integral research is for the company.
        *** A company whose core is research, will not let go of its core research department.
    ** It also depends on the profitability of the company, the number of employees it has, its expenditure, funding, etc.
    ** Thus, it is extremely important to do one's due diligence before joining or applying to a company.
* How does one research about a company?
    ** Go through the company's site to see what they do. Read blogs and articles to get a deeper understanding.
    ** Go through employee reviews on sites like link:https://www.glassdoor.com[Glassdoor^], link:https://www.teamblind.com/company[Blind^], etc.
    ** Talk to ex-employees.
    ** Ask the interviewer questions.
    ** Get a legal overview of the offer letter and one should themselves read it thoroughly as well.

* How should choose between a MNC corporate job vs a job at a startup?
    ** This is a debate between risk and growth.
    ** It mainly depends on one's risk-taking capacity.
    ** It is easier to experiment without repercussions at an earlier stage in one's career and coming from a privileged background also helps.
    ** Ideally one should look to maximize growth at earlier stages in their career.
* How can one figure out whether they will grow at an organisation?
    ** Check whether their product and audience is growing.
    ** Joining in at a point at which the company or product is pivoting to a new direction is good, as a lot of changes take place, which teaches one a lot.
    ** It is good if a company or product has started to scale up, because scaling up bring its own interesting problems.
    ** Although it is good if the company has a lot of problems to solve as that implies a lot of growth, but the company's stability has to be taken into account as well to ensure a certain level of job security. So, a balance between problems and company stability also has to be looked at.
        *** This balance can be tipped on either side depending on one's risk-taking capacity, career stage and monetary background.
