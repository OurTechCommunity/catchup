==== Topics Discussed

* General introductions.
* Prateek Pardeshi talked about using link:https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot^] at work versus using link:https://nodejs.org[Node.js^].
* We talked about why starting programming with link:https://www.java.com[Java^] rather than link:https://www.python.org[Python^] could be better. The general consensus was that Python spoils people with its in-built libraries and doesn't expose them to a standard link:https://www.educative.io/blog/object-oriented-programming[Object-Oriented Programming^] paradigm early on, which makes it difficult to adapt to such projects in the real world.
	** Obviously there is a lot of context involved in this point, as we were mainly considering Software Developers over people interested in AI and Data Science.

* We talked about what link:https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs[Emacs^] is - an extensible, customizable text editor that can a do a lot more than just text editing. link:https://emacsos.dev[Some even consider it an entire Operating System!^]
	** In the same vein, link:https://twitter.com/DSdatsme[Darshit Suratwala^] shared link:https://alacritty.org[Alacrity^], a modern terminal emulator that comes with sensible defaults, but allows for extensive configuration.
* link:https://twitter.com/harshgkapadia[Harsh Kapadia^] shared three satires on Tech-enthusiast stereotypes.

* We talked about how Java decodes Unicode characters in programs before starting lexical translation.
	** This can potentially bypass security tool checks, because innocuous-looking Unicode in comments can be used to end comments and execute random code, much like what happens in link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciNHn38EyRc[SQL Injections^].
