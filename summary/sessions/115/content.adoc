==== Topics Discussed

* General introductions.
* link:https://twitter.com/PranavDani3[Pranav Dani^] and link:https://twitter.com/DhiruCodes[Dheeraj Lalwani^] discussed today's link:https://twitter.com/WomenCoders01/status/1616951942588280834?s=20&t=WAjkgENi4zpp6W7PVWKs3g[MWC meetup^] in Churchgate.
    ** Overall, it was a good meetup. While most of the talks were aimed at "beginners", link:https://twitter.com/malkani_faiz[Faiz Malkani^]'s talk was more inclusive and talked about how one can find their foot in a world that seems enormous.    
* We discussed how GPUs are not always faster than CPUs in every scenario. 
    ** CPUs have a lower latency due to faster access to the cache memory.
    ** GPUs have a higher bandwidth.
    ** Harsh shared a video regarding the same: link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xi-wTlVUZsQ[Are GPUs Faster than CPUs?^]
* We talked about (link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS[FLOPS^]) Floating Point Operations Per Second, and how it affects the performance of a CPU.
    ** It is a method of encoding real numbers within the limits of finite precision available on computers.
* link:https://twitter.com/furtado_jaden[Jaden Furtado^] explained how an SQL injection works and also how _ScanRE_, the project he showcased, uses Regex to find vulnerabilities in the GitHub repositories.
    ** PhP implements sanitization in the form of a function called `mysqli_escape_string()` which was updated to `mysqli_real_escape_string()`, which could be used to mitigate SQL injection, although both versions have vulnerabilities.
* link:https://twitter.com/furtado_jaden[Jaden Furtado^] talked about how _ScanRE_ is split into four stages: Fetch, ScanCode, StoreResults and Delete.
    ** None of these parts are dependent on each other and can be run independently.
    ** Since they are independent, he is using link:https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/introduction.html[Celery^] to queue and run the tasks asynchronously.
        *** Anil Harwani suggested that this is essentially an out-of-order pipelining engine that is trying to get done as much work as it can with as much latency it can tolerate.
    ** Anil Harwani talked about how link:https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/introduction.html[Celery^] would act as point of vulnerability since now it is dependent on the developers maintaining link:https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/introduction.html[Celery^] to not mess up the codebase.
    ** link:https://twitter.com/furtado_jaden[Jaden Furtado^] suggested that he is essentially scanning the entirety of GitHub to find vulnerabilities in the codebase.
        *** Anil Harwani suggested that this would require differential scanning since the repositories are constantly changing.
* link:https://twitter.com/kaku_jay[Jay Kaku^] shared that his final year project is about making a coprocessor on a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array[FPGA^].
    ** link:https://twitter.com/furtado_jaden[Jaden Furtado^] asked multiple questions about the feasibility of the project and cooperation from the professors. 
* We discussed the common issues while switching from android to iOS, out of which WhatsApp migration is the most irritating for most users.
    ** While there are ways to handle the situation, it isn't user-friendly, which is how Apple locks users into its ecosystem of products and services.

==== Projects Showcased

* Wilfred showcased his link:https://wilfredalmeida.com[Portfolio Website^].
    ** His portfolio is a fork of link:https://brittanychiang.com[Brittany Chiang^]'s portfolio website which is also used by many people.
* link:https://twitter.com/furtado_jaden[Jaden Furtado^] shared his updates on _ScanRE_ - A tool for scanning and finding vulnerabilities in GitHub repositories using static code analysis.
    ** The tool checks for vulnerabilities in the code by using regex.
    ** He created a UI for the tool.
