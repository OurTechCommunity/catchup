==== Topics Discussed

* General Introductions.
* link:https://twitter.com/DhiruCodes[Dheeraj Lalwani^] talked about the self organised link:https://www.youtube.com/c/inanutshell[Kurzgesagt^] meetup that he recently attended in Mumbai. The crowd was eclectic in terms of working background. He met a few like minded science enthusiasts as well.
* link:https://twitter.com/PranavDani3[Pranav Dani^] shared why he has a predilection towards subjects like OS and DSA which are heavily logic oriented and also form the foundation of computers in a way. While machine learning certainly has some benefits over traditional methods, it is undeniably resource heavy. 
    ** link:https://twitter.com/DhiruCodes[Dheeraj Lalwani^] ka major project, finite automata to a digital circuit
    ** link:https://www.linkedin.com/in/anilharwani[Anil Harwani^] in contrast suggested that many utilities such as the search engine that we use almost on a daily basis, work on the concept of heuristics. Machine learning is very useful in many scenarios which means that it is not a replacement for traditional methods but rather a supplement.
    ** He also talked about the importance of having a good understanding of the fundamentals of any subject.
* link:https://www.linkedin.com/in/anilharwani[Anil Harwani^] talked about the Ice cream problem. Ice creams used to have less flavours such as chocolate or vanilla. People could choose any one and return home happily. Now flavours for ice creams have increased a lot, which means that their are too many choices for people to choose from.
    ** Choices are comparable to problems. One needs to choose a flavour and keep working in that direction.

    ** link:https://twitter.com/furtado_jaden[Jaden Furtado^] shared his experience of working with an OSS contribution (link:https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort/issues/4870[GitHub issue^]) where they suggested him to use link:https://ktor.io[Ktor^].

* We talked about work culture at some companies. Some might try to introduce competition between employees to gain quicker profits, while others might try to make it a collaborative environment where growth is steady.
* link:https://twitter.com/cdhiraj40[Dhiraj Chauhan^] and link:https://twitter.com/SirusTweets[Darshan Rander^] talked about web3. Web2 is established and important and can do most of the work so it is better not to ignore web2 while learning more about web3.
    ** link:https://twitter.com/cdhiraj40[Dhiraj Chauhan^] talked more about link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3EFi_POhps[proof of stake^], link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHsP935kWHo[proof of history^].

* We discussed how many websites nowadays might seem resource heavy. While novelty and design of a website surely matters, there should be a good balance between performance and practical design, since generally novelty drives web traffic.
    ** link:https://twitter.com/PranavDani3[Pranav Dani^] shared an example of a link:motherfuckingwebsite.com[NICE website^] which has a bare minimum resource requirement and still conveys the information that it needs to. This website might be a bit too simplistic for most people to use and understand so there's a requirement for balance.
* link:https://twitter.com/SaifSaifee_dev[Saifuddin Saifee^] and link:https://twitter.com/PranavDani3[Pranav Dani^] talked about how people might have interests in many fields but choose to talk about only one of them according to the audience.
    ** All the teams working on any product should have the sufficient knowledge of the parts of the product on which that team might not be working.
    ** We also discussed that many people might have preconcieved notions about a particular field which might foment a person's thinking in a certain direction about that field in general.
        *** For instance, even though the term `Fullstack Developer` might be misleading upto some extent, most recruiters might have grown numb to the use of such words which could potentially reduce a candidates chances of getting selected.
* link:https://twitter.com/SaifSaifee_dev[Saifuddin Saifee^] suggested that college committees might not provide its member the complete authority to conduct events as per their wishes. This is one of the potential reasons due to which people might choose to form their own communities without college ties.
