    ** link:https://twitter.com/AnxKhn[Anas Khan^] talked about Titan chipset and how it might interfere with installing a custom ROM.
* We talked about custom ROMs for Android, link:https://grapheneos.org[GrapheneOS^] in particular. A custom ROM essentially replaces the stock ROM or skin on your phone with the one you choose to install.
    ** There are multiple steps involved in installing a custom ROM such as unlocking bootloader, installing custom recovery and flashing different ROMs. 
    ** Most ROMs are based on the link:https://source.android.com[AOSP (Android Open Source Project)^].
    ** Each device implements a different link:https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-a-kernel-3040697[kernel^], hence custom ROMs need to be tweaked according to each device to make it work as intended.
    ** link:https://grapheneos.org[GrapheneOS^] is a privacy oriented custom ROM which does not use the standard google services since they track certain stats about the device, which an user might not want to share. It is available on almost all the Pixel devices starting from Pixel 3.
    ** link:https://e.foundation[/e/^] and link:https://calyxos.org[CalyxOS^] are also privacy oriented custom ROMs which work on similar principles.
    ** link:https://www.linkedin.com/in/mhshetty[Mohit Shetty^]
 talked about all the data that is accessible to google.
* link:https://twitter.com/SirusTweets[Darshan Rander^] and link:https://twitter.com/kaku_jay[Jay Kaku^] talked about a banking application which requires Android 8 (Oreo) as its minimum requirements to function as expected.

        *** link:https://archlinux.org[archlinux^], link:https://manjaro.org[manjaro^] and link:https://www.livemint.com[Mint^] might be one of the better distributions for new Linux users.

* We discussed why an user might want to shift to a custom ROM and the steps involved in doing so.
    ** Custom ROMs can be installed without root permissions. Most users prefer magisk, a link:https://www.howtogeek.com/249162/what-is-systemless-root-on-android-and-why-is-it-better[Systemless Root^] method for installing modifications to the ROM.
    ** Backing up personal data could be a hassel, hence services like link:https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keramidas.TitaniumBackup&hl=en_IN&gl=US[Titanium backup^] and link:https://swiftapps.org[Swift backup^] can help users to backup and restore all of their personal data with ease.
    ** Android implements Encryption by default, which makes it difficult for users to access the storage partition from the recovery environment. A user can choose to flash a DFE (Disable Forced Encryption) to disable the encryption.

* We talked about how android and iOS differ in terms of camera viewfinder implementation in different apps. 
    ** For instance, android developers tend to utilise the screenshot of the viewfinder in apps like Whatsapp or Instagram while clicking photos, whereas apps use the camera shots in iOS. 
    ** This is one of the major reasons behind better images on iphones, clicked through same app on both platforms.
* link:https://twitter.com/skxrxn[Sreekaran Srinath^] talked about his work of solving flagged issues at Spectro Cloud.
