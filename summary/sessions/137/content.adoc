==== Topics Discussed

* General introductions.
* Sampras D'Souza told us that he is working on Engineering Experience and Productivity, to make it easier for Developers at his company to build products.
* link:https://twitter.com/DSdatsme[Darshit Suratwala^] showed us a link:https://grafana.com/grafana[Grafana^] dashboard that his company uses in its product, to produce graphs and other visuals for telemetry data collected from link:https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/fundamentals/intro-to-prometheus[Prometheus^], which periodically collects data from various data sources.
	** From link:https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/getting-started/get-started-grafana-prometheus[Get started with Grafana and Prometheus^]:

	> Prometheus is an open source monitoring system for which Grafana provides out-of-the-box support. [...] create a series of dashboards in Grafana to display system metrics for a server monitored by Prometheus.

	** Darshit also shared link:https://go2.grafana.com/2023-07-GrafanaXDream11XCNCFMumbaiHappyHour-APAC.html[a Grafana meetup happening in Mumbai^].
	** link:https://k6.io[k6^], a Load-Testing software by Grafana Labs, was also shared.

* link:https://twitter.com/SirusTweets[Darshan Rander^] talked about his link:https://flutter.dev[Flutter^] Pull Request link:https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/127749[fix: wrong expansion tile shape assignment^].
	** We discussed how he found the issue while building a project and how he followed dependencies from one file to another in the Flutter source code to locate the exact code block causing the issue.
	** Darshan also told us how Flutter makes use of various tests to automatically test their code base on-the-fly. He told us how for some tests, actual app screens are rendered and compared pixel-by-pixel to figure out if the test passed or failed, and another set of tests that simulated Flutter's rendering in code by just comparing node trees.
* link:https://twitter.com/KartikSoneji_[Kartik Soneji^] showed us various link:https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/working-with-non-code-files[ways in which GitHub enables comparisons between new and old images in a Pull Request^].
* link:https://twitter.com/harshgkapadia[Harsh Kapadia^] asked link:https://twitter.com/KartikSoneji_[Kartik Soneji^] to review his `setup` link:https://www.gnu.org/software/bash[Bash^] script for his link:https://github.com/HarshKapadia2/dotfiles[dotfiles^] repository.
	** Kartik recommended putting the script through link:https://www.shellcheck.net[shellcheck.net^] to iron out issues and that resulted in a few link:https://github.com/HarshKapadia2/dotfiles/commit/486b86ab1dd062a519c6391b902b07aece14b755[safety changes of quoting variables^].

		*** link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10067266/when-to-wrap-quotes-around-a-shell-variable[When to wrap quotes around a shell variable?^]
* Anush showed us how customizable and powerful link:https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs[GNU Emacs^] is, with calendars and planners built into it. It is considered to be an Operating System in itself!
	** He told us about how link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1663627/guile-and-emacs[Emacs supports Elisp and GNU Guile^] for configurations. They are link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness[Turing Complete^] languages.
* Anush also showed us his Operating System link:https://guix.gnu.org[GNU Guix^], which is highly customizable.
	** It supports creating a configuration file that one can apply on any Guix install and get a consistent experience.
	** It can be said that link:https://nixos.org[Nix^] + link:https://www.gnu.org/software/guile[Guile^] = Guix.
		*** link:https://www.reddit.com/r/GUIX/comments/hxcq7d/guix_vs_nix[Guix vs. Nix^]
* We talked about link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24836183/what-is-the-difference-between-clang-and-llvm-and-gcc-g[What is the difference between clang (and LLVM) and gcc / g++?^]
* link:https://twitter.com/KartikSoneji_[Kartik Soneji^] told us about link:https://daniel.haxx.se/docs/curl-vs-wget.html[the difference between Curl and Wget^] and also showcased how link:https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#--libcurl[the `--libcurl` flag in Curl^] outputs pure C code that can be used to do the action the user requested through the command.
	** Curl is an extremely important library and a almost all software depends on it in some way.
		*** Eg: link:https://twitter.com/bagder/status/1666093552051576833[The newly released Diablo 4 video game has Curl in its credits.^]
* link:https://twitter.com/KartikSoneji_[Kartik Soneji^] showed us how GCC and Clang compile and optimize their code, by showing us Assembly output in link:https://godbolt.org[godbolt.org^]. He also showed us why Python is inefficient, due to repeated unoptimized function calls and other design-related tradeoffs.
