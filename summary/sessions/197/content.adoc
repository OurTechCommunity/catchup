* link:https://github.com/CosmicRaptor[Aryan Pathak^] told us about the differences between link:https://itsfoss.com/flatpak-vs-snap[Snaps and Flatpaks^] in Linux.
	** link:https://twitter.com/AnxKhn[Anas Khan^] shared link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikBPnYwnUMU[Snaps vs Flatpaks vs Appimages vs Packages: benchmarks, missing features & differences^].
* link:https://twitter.com/DhiruCodes[Dheeraj Lalwani^] asked us why a server running in a Docker container on an exported port does not work when the user tries connecting to it through the IP `0.0.0.0:8000` from the browser, when he has explicitly allowed any IP address to connect to the server at port 8000.
	** We helped Dheeraj remember that `0.0.0.0` is a wildcard that indicates that any IP address is acceptable, so entering `0.0.0.0:8000` in a browser doesn't actually point to any IP address, which is why the browser is not able to reach the intended server.
	** Dheeraj also expressed his interest in Docker networking, which is why link:https://twitter.com/harshgkapadia[Harsh Kapadia^] shared link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OU6xOM0SE4o[Docker Networking Crash Course^] and link:https://github.com/HarshKapadia2/mac-ip-routing[github.com/HarshKapadia2/mac-ip-routing^].
