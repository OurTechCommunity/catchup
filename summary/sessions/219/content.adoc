==== Topics Discussed

* Bhavesh Kukreja asked about posting certifications and Leetcode on LinkedIn.
	** There were mixed opinions, but the overall conclusion was to do it initially if one feels like it, but definitely transition out of that with time.
	** Obviously if the certification is an extremely respected or prestigious one, do post about it.
	** When it comes to Leetcode
	** Harsh Kapadia's thoughts
		*** Sharing projects and actual knowledge would be better than just posting about some certification.
		*** Sure, post about a certification if one cares about it and if it really is a prestigious one, but let that not be most of what one posts.
		*** If one has worked, built things and has shared knowledge, there is usually enough to share on social media and on one's résumé to automatically get rid of things that don't really matter.

* Cybersecurity
	** Jaden Furtado shared his talk at SINCON 2024 link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HchTam8e2A[Lights Out - Hacking Power Generation Infrastructure - by Karan Sajnani & Jaden Furtado^].
	** We talked about operating systems like Arch, link:https://www.blackarch.org[BlackArch^], Ubuntu, link:https://pop.system76.com[Pop!_OS^], link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parrot_OS[Parrot OS^] and Kali Linux from Cybersecurity and general usage standpoints.
	** Jaden Furtado told us how he uses link:https://www.shodan.io[Shodan^] to search for open ports and find security vulnerabilities, both at work and for his personal research.
		*** Harsh Kapadia asked why not use a tool like link:https://nmap.org[Nmap^], but Jaden said that if he uses the tool directly, then the firewalls of systems that he is trying to test or attack might find his IP address or just ban his IP address. Instead of setting up proxy machines to prevent his IP from being exposed, he just uses Shodan.
