==== Topics Discussed

* Ayush kicked off a discussion on **probability and algorithms**, specifically diving into **entropy encoders** like Huffman, Arithmetic, rANS, and tANS.
    ** He broke down concepts like `Log2(number of symbols)` and `2^n` in coding.
    ** He also explained **arithmetic coding**, highlighting its efficiency from `O(2^n)` to `O(n)`, and touched on cumulative frequency and probability functions.

* Lucky Mee, who's returning to tech after some time, asked for advice.
    ** Harsh strongly suggested focusing on **system designs**.
    ** He also emphasized the importance of planning thoroughly before execution.
* Abhigyan showcased his project on **stock analysis using AI agents**.
    ** He shared a research report he generated from the agents.
    ** He demonstrated how these reports provided structured outputs, detailing weaknesses, strengths, conclusions, graphs, and metrics.

* Chetan Jahangir shared some insights about **Builder AI**.
    ** He mentioned how the company allegedly scammed Microsoft.
    ** This sparked a conversation about how we should approach data derived from AI and LLMs.
* Ayush provided an update on his **SIH project**.
    ** He's concentrating on smart system design for hardware.
    ** He's currently learning about the **STM32 microprocessor**.

* Harsh questioned how **MCP (Multiple Connected Models)** relates to agentic AI.
    ** Abhigyan and Chetan clarified that it's essentially multiple models linked to a central one.
    ** They illustrated this with an example: a request for a weather update goes to the MCP, which then routes it to various models, with the configuration depending on the user.
* Chetan Jahangir sought advice on getting started with **research papers**.
    ** He asked for tips on how to begin and how to connect with people who write research papers to get involved and share knowledge.
    ** Rishit suggested reaching out to seniors and their professors.

* Swapnil Borkar discussed **AI and its impact on jobs**.
    ** He shared concerns about how AI could threaten junior roles if not utilized effectively.
* Jaden Furtado talked about **UPI, UPI Lite, and UPI Lite X**.
