==== Topics Discussed

* General Introduction
* We compared code editors including VSCode, Cursor, and Zed. Cursor offered superior AI support, while VSCode maintained its reliable features and Zed provided fast performance and enhanced vim integration.
* Sahil, Pranav, and Darshan discussed databases, phantom reads, transactions, and locks following a demonstration by Sahil.
* Rishit and Viranchee discussed implementing a convolution algorithm in both CUDA and CPU to address an interview question.
    ** link:https://sakana.ai/ai-cuda-engineer[Sakana AI^] originally claimed a 1000x speedup with CUDA, a claim that was later refuted on Twitter.
    ** We talked about how a GPU is different from a CPU and how to leverage the GPU's architecture to achieve a speedup.
* Sahil sought support for his database project, and Rishit recommended using an LLM to provide input in a structured format—pointing out that English is the ideal language both for writing code and for communicating with computers.
    ** Jaden suggested that LLM's are good replacent for compiler. 
* Thought Experiment: We explored a scenario where everyone had equal financial resources and AI, particularly LLMs, managed all tasks—discussing the potential social and economic impacts of such a world.
* Viranchee shared his approach for applying to jobs and getting interviews, emphasizing the importance of a relevant resume and applying early.
* Alpesh was working on a CTF and he asked for opinions on how to approach the challenge.
