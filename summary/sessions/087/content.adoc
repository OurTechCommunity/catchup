==== Topics Discussed

* General introductions
* link:https://twitter.com/rishit_dagli[Rishit Dagli^] told everyone that he was contributing to link:https://etcd.io[etcd^] which is a key-value store used by link:https://www.educative.io/blog/distributed-systems-considerations-tradeoffs[distributed systems^].
* We discussed the differences between Computer Engineering and Computer Science.
    ** link:https://twitter.com/rishit_dagli[Rishit Dagli^]'s perspective is that Computer Science is more about research and making stuff whereas Computer Engineering is more about implementation.
    ** link:https://twitter.com/harshgkapadia[Harsh Kapadia^]'s perspective is that Computer Engineering is more about hardware.
    ** link:https://twitter.com/cdhiraj40[Dhiraj Chauhan^] suggests that Computer Science involves a lot of theory.
* link:https://twitter.com/ishandeveloper[Ishan Sharma^] discussed the difference between Client Side Rendering (CSR) and Server Side Rendering (SSR).
    ** He shared an article about link:https://web.dev/rendering-on-the-web[rendering].
    ** link:https://twitter.com/ishandeveloper[Ishan Sharma^] showcased an old project to explain that CSR needs JavaScript to run on the main thread and it takes a lot of time.
    ** To overcome this issue, we use SSR which will atleast render things without JS.
    ** CSR + SSR is known as link:https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/isomorphic-javascript-the-future-of-web-apps-10882b7a2ebc[Isomorphic Rendering^].
* link:https://twitter.com/TmPreet[Preet Parekh^] brought to everyone's attention that link:https://nextjs.org[Next.js^] is introducing a lot of breaking changes in their upcoming update.
    ** He also talked about a new feature introduced by link:https://nextjs.org[Next.js^] which will eliminate the need of client side JavaScript while streaming. 
    ** Streaming allows to constantly modify the DOM.

* link:https://twitter.com/SirusTweets[Darshan Rander^] discussed an issue in JavaScript where he was unable to delete the childNodes in an array and link:https://twitter.com/harshgkapadia[Harsh Kapadia^] shared a link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhvec8cXLlo[video on difference between children and childNodes] by link:https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified[Web Dev Simplified].
* We talked about link:https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose[Jetpack Compose^], how link:https://flutter.dev[Flutter^] uses the link:https://skia.org[Skia engine^] to render and native components.
* We discussed the pros and cons of link:https://www.java.com/en[Java^] and link:https://kotlinlang.org[Kotlin^].
    ** Kotlin has a lot of abstractions and a loads of syntatic sugar.
* link:https://twitter.com/harshgkapadia[Harsh Kapadia^] asked link:https://twitter.com/rishit_dagli[Rishit Dagli^] about transformers and he shared a link to a paper: link:https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762[Attention is all you need].
* link:https://twitter.com/SirusTweets[Darshan Rander^] asked link:https://twitter.com/rishit_dagli[Rishit Dagli^] about Modality and Rishit shared a link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur0HHfQzg78[video^].
* We talked about link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation[AOT (Ahead Of Time)^], link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation[JIT (Just In Time)^] compilation.
* link:https://twitter.com/TmPreet[Preet Parekh^] shared that: The goal of link:https://wasi.dev[WASI = WebAssembly System Interface^] is to create a very modular set of system interfaces.
* link:https://twitter.com/Darth_Sid512[Siddharth Bhatia^] shared a project: link:https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs[Linux from scratch] which claims: "We installed a system that was just enough to run the Apache web server; total disk space usage was approximately 8 MB. With further stripping, that can be brought down to 5 MB or less. Try that with a regular distribution."
* We then talked about Learning something in depth vs learning things just on the surface level and concluded that following a T-shaped for learning is better, where you find 1 or 2 domains in which you specialize and have surface-level knowledge of the rest of them.
* link:https://twitter.com/poonmjha[Poonam Jha^] shared a new initiative in which, she want's to help people find their interest in IT.
