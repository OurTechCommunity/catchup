* link:https://twitter.com/harshgkapadia[Harsh Kapadia^] showcased an example about string literals.
    ** He defined two functions: one that returns a string literal and another that returns an array of characters (returns starting address of the array).
    ** Since the array is local to the function, it is destroyed after the function returns, causing a segmentation fault. In contrast, the string literal is stored in the read-only section of memory, allowing it to be returned without causing a fault.
