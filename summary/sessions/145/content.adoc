	** Anil suggested reading link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month[The Mythical Man-Month^] once again, to understand how project requirements work with regards to clarifying the needs and goals, and figuring out how much time it needs and how many people it needs.

* Anil Harwani told us about link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanenbaum%E2%80%93Torvalds_debate[the Tanenbaum-Torvalds debate^], which was an argument where Tanenbaum was trying to prove why a Microkernel architecture (Tanenbaum's OS Minix had that architecture.) is better than a Monolithic Kernel architecture that Torvald's Linux has.
	** Kernel architectures
		*** link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4537850/what-is-difference-between-monolithic-and-micro-kernel[Microkernel vs Monolithic Kernel^]
		*** link:https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-microkernel-and-monolithic-kernel[Difference between Microkernel and Monolithic Kernel^]
	** Minix
		*** Tanenbaum initially created the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minix[Minix^] Operating System for educational purposes.
		*** Anil also told us how Minix was found inside the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Management_Engine[Intel Management Engine^], which was a big deal, as Minix, whose goal was never to have military-grade security, was being used on billions of machines at a privilege level that is higher than the kernel, and that made billions of machines vulnerable. Also, this implies that Minix is the most used OS on the planet.
