[quote, Anil Harwani]
You rise up to your incompetence.

* We talked about link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability,_availability_and_serviceability[Reliability, Availability and Serviceability (RAS)^].
* link:https://twitter.com/gupta_shrinath[Shrinath Gupta^] asked how he could make his team follow best practices when not being in a leadership position. People told him that he could try to make his teammates understand, but it would be very difficult, as not everyone is equally passionate and/or caring about things and don't want to go the extra mile for a fixed salary. Not being in a commanding position makes it even more difficult. He was advised to maintain a code standard for himself and eventually leave the company if the code standards were very bad and things don't improve at all.
    ** link:https://twitter.com/omtalk[Omkar Khair^] gave a good piece of advice here. He said that 90% people are very limited in what they do or don't do anything. It is up to us to find the 10% people who do actual work and build a network with them.
    ** Omkar also said that in trying to resolve issues at work, one should not lose sight of technical correctness and one's code standard, because if everyone jumps off a cliff, you don't need to as well.

* Comparing Technologies
    ** We talked about how media articles influence people's minds about different Technology and rather than comparing individual use cases, they make a blanket statement (Eg: Calling one processor just better than the other for all use cases) and influence the common masses.
    ** As per link:https://www.linkedin.com/in/anilharwani[Anil Harwani^], x86 and ARM processors shouldn't be compared, because the use cases and workloads are different.
    ** How link:https://twitter.com/marcan42/status/1494213855387734019[Apple lied about their custom NVMe drives^] was discussed as well.
* Power states and power models in computers.
