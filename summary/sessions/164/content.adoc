* Buffer Overflow, Segmentation Faults and Exceptions
	** link:https://twitter.com/KartikSoneji_[Kartik Soneji^] explained what a Buffer Overflow is and why every Buffer Overflow does not cause a Segmentation Fault.
		*** A Buffer Overflow is essentially writing more data into a buffer than it was allocated for, leading to over-writing the data after the buffer in the program's memory.
		*** A Segmentation Fault is an Exception generated when a program tries to access a memory address that is outside the memory segment (process address space) allocated to it by the Operating System or when it does not have the permission to access that particular memory location.
		*** A Buffer Overflow writes data beyond a buffer's allocated memory and this can cause a Segmentation Fault (Segfault) if the buffer is located near the end of the memory space allocated to the process and the overflow tries to write to an address beyond  the address space allocated to the process.

* Endianness
	** link:https://twitter.com/adityaoberai1[Aditya Oberai^] told us how the terms 'little-endian' and 'big-endian' originated from the famous Gulliver's Travels story. This has been coined and explained in the original link:https://www.rfc-editor.org/ien/ien137.txt[137th Internet Engineering Note (IEN 137)^].
	** We talked about how it is important to know a system's Endianness, because answers can differ based on the byte storage order, especially with pointer truncation and bitwise operations.

* link:https://twitter.com/KartikSoneji_[Kartik Soneji^] told us how the C programming language got a Boolean datatype and the story behind the need for `stdbool.h`.
	** C did not have a Boolean datatype till the link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3667708/where-can-i-read-c99-official-language-standard-manual-reference-specification-o[C99 standard^]. It was added in C99, but was named as `_Bool` instead of the standard `bool` to not break millions of existing C programs, because a lot of C programs had already made custom definitions for `bool` in their programs and so adding `bool` as a datatype would break those `#define` declarations.
	** To make `bool` available for newer programs, a header file `stdbool.h` was created, that essentially defined `bool` and `_Bool` and thus allowed newer programs to use `bool` as a datatype.
