==== Topics Discussed

* Chintan Gurjar shared insights about cybersecurity certifications and their role in the industry.
    ** He discussed the difference between certifications in coding versus cybersecurity, noting that unlike coding fields like Java where there aren't world-wide recognized certifications, cybersecurity has established certification programs.
    ** Chintan explained why certifications matter in cybersecurity, especially for consulting companies.
        *** He shared his personal experience: during his first 5 years, he didn't believe in certifications and didn't have any.
        *** When he landed his 3rd job at KPMG New Zealand, his boss explained the value of certifications from a business perspective.
    ** Chintan explained how certifications are used in project proposals and client acquisition.
        *** When competing for projects, consulting firms (including Big 4 companies) showcase their team's credentials.
        *** Companies highlight how many OSCP-certified or CEH-certified professionals they have to demonstrate expertise to potential clients.
        *** This portfolio of certifications helps firms win projects, which is why companies are often willing to pay for employee certifications.
    ** The discussion covered differences in interview processes between coding and cybersecurity roles.
        *** For coding positions, companies typically give coding tasks (like LeetCode problems) where they can observe thought process, methodology, and coding skills directly.
        *** In cybersecurity, the interview process is more complex due to multiple sub-domains (VAPT, GRC, Threat Detection Engineering, etc.).
        *** For VAPT roles, setting up vulnerable infrastructure for technical interviews requires significant maintenance and management overhead.
        *** For GRC roles, there's often no technical component to assess, making it harder to evaluate candidates.
        *** For specialized roles like Threat Detection Engineering, setting up interview infrastructure would be prohibitively expensive and complex.
    ** Chintan emphasized that certifications should be viewed as a tiebreaker, not the primary hiring criterion.
        *** The hiring process should start with resume-based analysis of 6-7 candidates, followed by interviews.
        *** If multiple candidates perform equally well, certifications can serve as a differentiator.
    ** Key takeaway: The main goal should be to learn cybersecurity; certifications should act as proof of knowledge, not the primary learning objective.
