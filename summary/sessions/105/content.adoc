    ** He talked about the journey of electric waves where multiple data streams are combined into a Fourier transform and then smashed into a single sine wave stream and sent over the network.
    ** link:https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/topic/pdf-file-format-basic-structure/[PDF file format^] was discussed and he said that most PDF tools do not follow this structure.

==== Projects Showcased

* link:https://twitter.com/furtado_jaden[Jaden Furtado^]showcased his project _Static Analysis_ which identifies and records vulnerabilities in the code on GitHub or GitLab.
    ** It was built with scaling in mind.
        *** He used celery for task queueing and processing sequentially.
