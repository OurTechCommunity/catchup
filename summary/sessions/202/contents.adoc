==== Topics Discusssed

* We talked about link:https://dev.harshkapadia.me/resources#new-linesline-endings[new lines and line endings in different machines^].
	** We watched a link:https://youtu.be/ObgXrIYKQjc[video with CR and LF keys on a Teletype Model 33 ASR^].
		*** Just like the carriage return word is an artefact from the Teletype models, the bell (as heard in the video above) is also an artefact from Teletypes. It can be heard on the Windows Command Prompt (cmd) by executing `echo \a` or `echo \07`.
* We talked about Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Competitive Programming and languages for solving DSA questions.
	** link:https://pypi.org/project/Bython[Bython^] - Python with braces
	** To resolve issues with not being able to translate understood concepts to code, the advice given was to understand the concept, write pseudo-code on paper and then try to code it. Essentially, the more one codes, the easier it becomes, so another advice was to code a lot.
	** Kartik Soneji suggested link:https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230[Grokking Algorithms^].
* Harsh Kapadia asked for help with trying to figure out how Machine Code translates to Assembly when `objdump` is used to disassemble an executable.
	** We were able to partially understand the translation using the link:https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-sdm.html[Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer Manuals^].
	** We also looked at link:https://ref.x86asm.net[ref.x86asm.net^] and link:https://eng.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Computer_Science/Programming_Languages/Introduction_to_Assembly_Language_Programming%3A_From_Soup_to_Nuts%3A_ARM_Edition_(Kann)/06%3A_New_Page/6.03%3A_New_Page[Decoding Machine Code^] without much success.
* Harsh Kapadia shared
	** link:https://youtu.be/F8cT1YCsxgo[i was right.^]
		*** This was regarding Microsoft wanting to lock down the Windows kernel from kernel-level drivers for anti-cheat, anti-virus and other purposes, in response to link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCxvyIx922A[the Crowdstrike incident^].

* Rishit Dagli shared and talked about
	** link:https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.09568[Shampoo: Preconditioned Stochastic Tensor Optimization^]
	** link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_delta[Kronecker delta^]
	** The importance of the discovery of Fast Fourier Transforms, as it led to wars ending and nuclear testing getting restricted.
		*** link:https://medium.com/@pdoeunMind/fft-detecting-nuclear-tests-after-oppenheimer-7443562c741d[FFT:Detecting Nuclear Tests After Oppenheimer^]
		*** link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmgFG7PUHfo[The Remarkable Story Behind The Most Important Algorithm Of All Time^]
	** The fact that what we consider an image is actually the impulse response of an image.
* We talked about AGI and Superintelligence.
	** Rishit thinks that AGI will be achieved in his lifetime, but is decades away from being a reality. He also thinks that machines becoming smarter than humans is inevitable.
