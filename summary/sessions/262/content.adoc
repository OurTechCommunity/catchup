He got his internship after his 5th semester and has been working since.
	** Janvi Matani asked for advice on finding internships as a 2nd year IT student.
		*** Suyash and others suggested targeting small startups and reaching out directly to founders on LinkedIn rather than relying on job portals like Internshala.

* Rehan shared about the Operating System series by Adhokshaj Mishra.
	** Back to basics lectures covering OS fundamentals, focusing on understanding why certain designs were chosen rather than just definitions.
	** Adhokshaj has built his own OS and created a programming language in Sanskrit.

* Jaden explained what eBPF is.
	** It's like an API for running code at the kernel level, allowing operations that would normally require kernel drivers.
	** Useful for network packet filtering and kernel-level operations without the overhead of traditional syscalls.
* Discussion about the difference between syscall wrappers (glibc) and actual syscalls.
	** Glibc wrappers like `open()` use variadic arguments (the `...` syntax in C) to provide flexibility.
	** The wrapper handles default parameters and then calls the actual syscall.
* Chirag joined and discussed his work.
	** Talked about the difference between product companies and consulting firms for sales engineers.
	** His daily work involves gathering customer requirements for cloud migration and designing proposals.
