    ** Aniket Kadam talked about how AI is bad at consistency, while link:https://twitter.com/rishit_dagli[Rishit Dagli^] tried to counter the argument by suggesting that it is a math problem and can be solved eventually.

* link:https://twitter.com/rishit_dagli[Rishit Dagli^] discussed the out-of-distribution (OOD) problem, stating that models can only generate in-distribution (IID) data.

    ** He also shared a link:https://rishit-dagli.github.io/2024/01/01/sgd.html#:~:text=Theorem%20(Gnedenko%2DKolmogorov,the%20stable%20distribution[blog post^] where he wrote about a part of this topic.
