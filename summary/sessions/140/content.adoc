* link:https://twitter.com/harshgkapadia[Harsh Kapadia^] talked about how the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Platform_Management_Interface#Baseboard_management_controller[Baseboard Management Controller (BMC)^] of a server motherboard gets its own IP and has its own web interface to help configure the motherboard (turning power on or off, updating BIOS and board firmware, getting a GUI for the machine, etc.) and how he used link:https://codeberg.org/IPMITool/ipmitool[`ipmitool`^] to re-gain lost access to the BMC by re-configuring a password for the default `admin` user.
* link:https://twitter.com/harshgkapadia[Harsh Kapadia^] talked about his Networking experiment at his internship at link:https://www.amd.com[AMD^], where he had to configure two servers and a link:https://support.mellanox.com/s/productdetails/a2v50000000dZMZAA2/sn2100[Mellanox SN2100 Switch^] to be able to achieve a throughput of 100 Gbps over link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkOVgkcrvbg[Ethernet^].
    ** He talked about how it was a challenge to set up and configure the server and switches to be able to ping each other, as he needed to realise that
        *** Connecting to the switch to be able to configure it and enable SSH access to it, required a console cable, which is supposed to be a serial cable.
        *** The servers required the link:https://support.mellanox.com/s/productdetails/a2v50000000XcQ7AAK/mlnxofed[`MLNX_OFED` drivers`^] so that the link:https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/ethernet/connectx-5[Mellanox ConnectX-5 NIC^] could be configured.
    ** He was only able to achieve 20 Gbps when he used link:https://github.com/esnet/iperf[iperf3^] to check his network connectivity for the first time.
    ** He then mentioned that he would write a blog on the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS[BIOS^] (link:https://infohub.delltechnologies.com/l/cpu-best-practices-3/poweredge-numa-nodes-per-socket-1[NPS^], etc.), OS, iperf3 and CPU optimizations that he had to make to get the throughput to 60 Gbps.
