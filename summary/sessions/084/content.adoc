* link:https://www.linkedin.com/in/anilharwani[Anil Harwani^] talked about testing and fine tuning CPUs using link:https://www.slothparadise.com/compile-hpl-linpack[HPL (LINPACK)^]. Scores reported for CPU comparisons are generally output values from these tests.

        *** Resource Hints help the browser load pages faster by telling it which assets might be needed in the future.
* link:https://twitter.com/ishandeveloper[Ishan Sharma^] discussed the potential reasons for his internship project link:https://www.hackerdraw.com[HackerDraw^] to run slower.
    ** This is when he learnt more about Web Performance. He discussed the importance of link:https://web.dev/learn-web-vitals[Web Vitals^] and how it helps in optimising a web site for faster load times and better User Experience.

        *** link:https://amazon.com[Amazon^], which was touted to be one of the fastest consumer web sites, turned out to be one of the slowest web sites, but it just appeared fast due to clever optimisations for faster initial visible page load. It tends to load the link:https://www.lonefircreative.com/blog/what-does-above-the-fold-mean[above-the-fold content^] on the web app very fast, thus reducing FCP which in turn looks like the site is faster.
    ** He talked about link:https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/edge-network/overview[Vercel Edge Network^] and how websites which use caching load faster.
