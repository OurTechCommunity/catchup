* link:https://twitter.com/_SaketThota[Saket Thota^], link:https://linkedin.com/in/krishna-gadia[Krishna Gadia^] and link:https://twitter.com/harshgkapadia[Harsh Kapadia^] talked about the benefits of Competitive Programming (CP) and discussed how it helps with quick thinking and writing optimized code. Obviously just like everything else, CP has its own drawbacks in writing unreadable and overly-optimized code.
* link:https://twitter.com/harshgkapadia[Harsh Kapadia^] encouraged link:https://twitter.com/_SaketThota[Saket Thota^] to use his experience to bring experienced Competitive Programmers together to talk about topics deeper than the usual 'Getting Started with Competitive Programming' topics. He also suggested talking about how problems are made and the rationale behind certain ways of solving problems.
* link:https://linkedin.com/in/krishna-gadia[Krishna Gadia^] recommended reading link:https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com[Cracking the Coding Interview^] to do well in interviews, because even if Competitive Programming (CP) is not what will be done on the job, problem solving (which is essentially CP), is what is done daily on the job.
	** CP is an easier way to test problem solving skills than solving a real-world (on-the-job) problem.
* link:https://linkedin.com/in/krishna-gadia[Krishna Gadia^] and Anil Harwani talked about how one should cope with leaving jobs by taking a small break (if financially affordable), looking for jobs through friends and interviewing at multiple places.

* link:https://linkedin.com/in/krishna-gadia[Krishna Gadia^] and link:https://twitter.com/harshgkapadia[Harsh Kapadia^] also talked about link:https://www.tipsforassistants.com/post/2016/05/13/importance-vs-urgency[the difference between Importance and Urgency^] to have the correct priorities in life. Harsh talked about how he has only been able to partially implement this in his life.
* link:https://linkedin.com/in/krishna-gadia[Krishna Gadia^] advised link:https://twitter.com/harshgkapadia[Harsh Kapadia^] to reduce unnecessary brain engagement to free mental capacity to be able to think more and with clarity.
	** Things like always playing music while working and continuously watching engaging content during breaks leads to brain capacity being used quite a bit.
	** Being present in the moment, link:https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mindful[mindful^] and cognizant can help a lot.
	** Meditating or just sitting and focusing on one's breath while not thinking of anything else is one way to calm oneself and reduce engagement.
