	** Harsh asked Chirag Nayyar, who works in Cloud Pre-sales, how technical teams at his compamy handled such cases and helped clients.
		** Chirag said that
			** They first figure out who is going to add the patch or security fix, the Cloud vendor (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.) or the customer themselves.
			** Then, they figure out whether the fix can be applied on-the-fly or whether the service needs to go down, be patched up and then be spun up again.
		** Once the above factors are clear, the team can make a plan to help the customer to avoid any down time or service disruptions, through adding redundancies or other techniques.
