==== Topics Discussed

* We discussed how link:https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt[ChatGPT^] is gaining popularity.
    ** Microsoft has acquired the majority stake in link:https://openai.com[OpenAI^], the company behind ChatGPT.
        *** This could also imply that Microsoft services such as the Bing Search Engine might use ChatGPT to provide better search results.
    ** link:https://twitter.com/SiddharthCoding[Siddharth Bhatia^] shared link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gencay.vscode-chatgpt[a VS Code extension for ChatGPT^].
* link:https://twitter.com/KarkeraNikshita[Nikshita Karkera^] shared a video about how link:https://www.youtube.com/shorts/aO1qDzkU9o0[Artificial Intelligence follows a set of rules^] to generate responses and why it isn't sentient at this point.
* After link:https://twitter.com/AnxKhn[Anas Khan^]'s _CodeClip_ project showcase, Anil Harwani talked about how everyone trying to build something should understand how things work.
    ** The reason is that whenever something goes wrong in a tool, you should be able to understand the problem and debug it, or even better contribute to its functionality.
    ** Once the size of the code base starts increasing, it becomes difficult to handle the code, so he suggested going through a lot of code and understanding it.
* link:https://twitter.com/SaifSaifee_dev[Saifuddin Saifee^] and link:https://twitter.com/AnxKhn[Anas Khan^] talked about how they feel comfortable using a certain library and the reason for working on a project with the same.
    ** Anil Harwani added that a tool should be used when it solves the complete purpose and provides the necessary fallback actions.
* We talked about databases and the use cases for SQL and NoSQL.
    ** NoSQL databases are fast and scalable for average use cases.
    ** Relational databases are applicable to most use cases, but they have a lot of overhead on the data modeling (schematic) side. Maintaining these databases is a hassle as well, due to numerous rigid constraints in place for integrity and other properties.
        *** For instance, updates and inserts in Relational Databases can be very expensive from time to time.
    ** We talked about how link:https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html[SQLite^] might be one of the biggest database engines, and is known to be notoriously stable and simple to use. The documentation is simple and easy to understand as well.
* The link:https://sqlite.org[SQLite^] web site server is a single-person endeavor, and the server is written in C and is self-hosted.
    ** We discussed how people can also write servers in C and link:https://www.gnu.org/software/bash[Bash^]. Anil Harwani shared an article about link:https://funprojects.blog/2021/04/11/a-web-server-in-1-line-of-bash[writing a server in 1 line^].
* We talked about certain use cases for link:https://twitter.com/WilfredAlmeida_[Wilfred Almeida^]'s _MobXcess_ project that he showcased.
    ** link:https://twitter.com/harshgkapadia[Harsh Kapadia^] discussed how the application could be improved by addressing a reliability issue for link:https://oauth.net[OAuth^] where someone could link:https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack[DDoS^] the application in its current state.
* We discussed how link:https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/protocol[SSH (Secure Shell)^] came into the existence.
    ** A precursor to SSH was the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet[Telnet^], which enables connection with a remote server but it does so in plain text, which can be intercepted and used by anyone.
    ** SSH was defined for maintenance tasks where the term 'maintenance' never had a boundary.
    ** Since SSH is open source, it is as secure for any user as it is for any company using it.
* Anil Harwani suggested reading link:https://sre.google/books[Site Reliability Engineering^] reference books for understanding the points to keep in mind while building a secure application.
* link:https://twitter.com/PranavDani3[Pranav Dani^] talked about the Alumni meet at his college where he and Anil Harwani talked about how to approach reading reference books.
    ** The difference between reading and comprehension makes all the difference in whether one has understood a concept.
* link:https://twitter.com/skxrxn[Sreekaran Srinath^], link:https://twitter.com/PranavDani3[Pranav Dani^] and link:https://twitter.com/adityaoberai1[Aditya Oberai^] talked about Forex transaction rates and which banks provide good deals.
    ** We discussed the most annoying things about Forex transactions which pertain to not receiving an OTP for any transaction on the card.
    ** Apparently link:https://www.apple.com/apple-card[Apple Card^] is causing losses, since it is an average card with not a lot of benefits.
    ** People don't handle Credit Cards properly and hence banks end up making more money.
    ** link:https://twitter.com/skxrxn[Sreekaran Srinath^] talked about Credit Card churning to get the most benefits out of a card.
