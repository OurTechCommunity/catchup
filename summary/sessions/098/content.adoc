    ** We talked about digital communication, how it is made secure using the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography[public key cryptography^] and how link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate[digital certificates^] help with that.
    ** We then discussed how link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security[TLS^] and link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol[OCSP^] hits the certificate authority to verify the certificate.
        *** link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_revocation_list[CRL - Certificate revocation list^] checks for the certificate locally and if it exists  then it does not make a request.

    ** Most Indian students do jobs or study engineering since it is a means to an end.
    ** Nine times out of ten, a job is a means to an end and that's why it's called a job.
* We discussed ways in which a processor can go idle to save power.
    ** link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_gating[Clocked Gating^]. Clock gating is a power-saving feature in semiconductor microelectronics that enables switching off circuits.
    ** link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_gating[Power Gating^]. Power gating is a technique used in integrated circuit design to reduce power consumption, by shutting off the current to blocks of the circuit that are not in use.
* We talked about how foundational courses that colleges include in syllabus are very important to become a good software engineer.
    ** Many people have lost the ability to dive deep into a topic and understand the crux of it.
    ** Documenting ways to implement a project is not helpful for others since many people would then start building the same project even though they aren't qualified to build it. This is a problem since people who do not understand whats happening will then blame the creator.

* link:https://twitter.com/DhiruCodes[Dheeraj Lalwani^] shared an issue he faced at his internship where he changed a function's response without realizing that it has been used in multiple places which led to a ripple effect breaking everything. link:https://www.linkedin.com/in/anilharwani[Anil Harwani^] said that it could have been avoided with a simple search had he just checked once before where that particular function had been used.
    ** link:https://www.linkedin.com/in/anilharwani[Anil Harwani^] said, our generation has forgot to read code. He suggested to spend more time reading code and understanding its usage, and then writing code.
* We then talked about Facts, axioms - that are true.
    ** known known - things that we as humans understand.
    ** known unknown - things that we don't know.
    ** unknown unknown - things that we don't know (Someone puts efforts and makes it work).
