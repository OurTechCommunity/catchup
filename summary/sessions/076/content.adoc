    ** link:https://twitter.com/harshgkapadia[Harsh Kapadia^] showed link:https://support.google.com/mail/answer/11555490[Gmail's new UI^] to everyone.
    ** Looking at all the rounded corners in Gmail's new UI, link:https://twitter.com/omtalk[Omkar Khair^] told us the importance of optimal use of link:https://www.usabilityfirst.com/glossary/screen-real-estate/index.html[screen real estate^].
        *** Text bleeds much earlier with rounded corners than with square corners, so lesser data can be fit into a component.
        *** link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_user[Power users^] are so quick and adept at navigating a software, that their clicks and touches don't always hit the center of a button. Circular buttons reduce the area occupied by the button (than if it were square or rectangular) and it becomes imperative to hit the center of the button, which is detrimental to the efficiency of power users.
    ** link:https://twitter.com/tusharnankanii[Tushar Nankani^] said that for UIs, the first impression is not just the last impression, it is the lasting impression.
* link:https://twitter.com/omtalk[Omkar Khair^] talked about Enterprise Lobbying and Partner Programs.
    ** He told us how Partner Programs by various companies incentivise the partner companies to use their products, generating Billions of Dollars in revenue for the program company. Such programs usually provide the partner company with good certifications for their employees, helpful sessions to understand the program company's products, back channel support to improve products/services of the partner companies, etc.
    ** He also told us that partner ecosystems are very important for a product to succeed. The Windows Phone did not have a good partner system, with no YouTube, Google Maps and other commonly used apps, and this was one of the reasons the phone did not really succeed.
