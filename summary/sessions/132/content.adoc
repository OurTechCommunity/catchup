==== Topics Discussed

* link:https://twitter.com/saurabhdawaree[Saurabh Daware^] and link:https://twitter.com/PranavDani3[Pranav Dani^] distilled different types of jobs available based on need and skills.
    ** We discussed the specifics of different domains like cloud, frontend, and backend.
        *** There's no right time to make a switch in job roles. 
        *** Changing roles can help prevent mental stagnation.
    ** Darshit Suratwala talked about how banks work on different projects.
* link:https://twitter.com/saurabhdawaree[Saurabh Daware^] shared how his team works with the frontend by creating and maintaining React libraries for the organization.
* We discussed potential improvements and similar implementations for link:https://github.com/Chirag-And-Dheeraj/vaulter[Vaulter^] â€” A WIP project by link:https://twitter.com/DhiruCodes[Dheeraj Lalwani^] and link:https://twitter.com/_chiraglulla_[Chirag Lulla^].
    ** Darshit Suratwala said that in the case of link:https://cloud.google.com[GCP^], the libraries support chunked uploads and the user can avoid the server and directly upload in the bucket.
    ** They discussed the link:https://www.samba.org[Samba^] server and link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol[FTP^] implementations.
    ** Anil Harwani talked about how file chunks are processed and saved in a drive.
        *** How does block storage ensure that you never lose data? Is it storing all the data in one single hard drive?
            **** Many cases implement sequential file chunking and saving.
            **** Either store the data in a single hard drive or save multiple copies of it across multiple hard drives.
            **** If stored on a single drive, chances of failure are high, so instead of that store it in multiple 1 GB chunks and create a hash function for addressing.
            **** Every 1 gig chunk can have a parity algorithm to check the consistency of the data.
            **** Check parity between each chunk and store it across multiple drives.
        *** The working is similar to link:https://www.westerndigital.com/en-in/solutions/raid[RAID storage^].
            **** Each system has a fault tolerance limit for drive failure.
        *** Metadata databases require high read speeds because a delay in response from the metadata database can lead to a ripple of delays in subsequent calls for file chunks/blocks from the block storage.
        *** This leads to poor performance, eventually causing poor user experience.
            **** Differences in latency in the hierarchy of storage from the CPU cache to the hard drive range from nanoseconds to milliseconds.
    ** How will the self-hosting happen?
        *** The idea is to create a simple executable for users to run on their server of choice.
            **** link:https://twitter.com/saurabhdawaree[Saurabh Daware^] suggested that he should first get the bare bones ready and then scale up from there.
            **** By this time, work on optimizing the system and working on edge cases.
    ** link:https://github.com/bashbaugh/cloud-storage-file-browser[GCP Storage Browser^] and link:https://deta.space/discovery/@gyrooo/filebox[Filebox^] have similar implementations.
* We discussed some struggles of students living abroad.
    ** Choosing the right professors for courses based on link:https://scholar.google.com[Google Scholar^] and not link:https://www.ratemyprofessors.com[Ratemyprofessor^].
    ** Handling food and cooking.
* link:https://twitter.com/DhiruCodes[Dheeraj Lalwani^] shared some links about the community around languages:
    ** link:https://www.allthingsdistributed.com[All Things Distributed^], blogs by Werner Vogels, CTO of Amazon.
    ** link:https://transitiontech.ca/random/RIIR[RIIR^], considering rewriting stuff in Rust.
* link:https://twitter.com/kaku_jay[Jay Kaku^] and link:https://twitter.com/PranavDani3[Pranav Dani^] talked about system circuits and the evolution of binary.
    ** link:https://youtu.be/FU_YFpfDqqA[Why Lightbulbs Might Be The Best Invention Ever^] - a video by link:https://www.youtube.com/@veritasium[Veritasium^] which talks about the usage of light bulbs and circuits to explain the evolution of circuits.
        *** Bulbs and vacuum tubes used up a lot of power and required frequent replacements. This is what rendered them impractical and unreliable. 
    ** Division operation is a pain for ARM processors since most don't have a dedicated circuit that can deal with FPU (Floating Point Unit) division operations.
        *** link:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_algorithm[Division Algorithm^]
        *** link:https://youtu.be/ssDBqQ5f5_0[why are computers horrible at division? (a painful discovery)^] - a video by link:https://www.youtube.com/@LowLevelLearning[Low Level Learning^].
* link:https://in.nothing.tech[Nothing^] has a collaboration with link:https://teenage.engineering[teenage engineering^] for their products.
* Touch typing can be helpful for easily and optimally typing on keyboards.
    ** Most people can learn touch typing within 1 month if they had some experience with using musical instruments since that involves using multiple fingers simultaneously.
* link:https://twitter.com/adityaoberai1[Aditya Oberai^] and Darshit Suratwala talked about potential MITM (Man in the Middle) attacks using link:https://www.wireshark.org[Wireshark^].
    ** Wireshark is a packet analyzer that can be used to analyze network traffic, but most of the times the data is encrypted and hence it cannot alter requests with positive outcomes.
    ** ISPs use similar ways to analyze traffic.

==== Projects Showcased

* link:https://twitter.com/DhiruCodes[Dheeraj Lalwani^] shared his progress on _Vaulter_, a self-hosted storage server.
    ** It is a simple file-sharing and self-hosted storage server, inspired by an open-source web-based collection server and streamer, link:https://www.navidrome.org[Navidrome^] that he had earlier worked with.
