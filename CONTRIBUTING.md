## Tech Stack

-   Front end: HTML, CSS, JS, [Asciidoctor Jet](https://harshkapadia2.github.io/asciidoctor-jet)
-   Back end: Express.js, [Deta Micro](https://docs.deta.sh/docs/home/#deta-micros), [Deta Base](https://docs.deta.sh/docs/home/#deta-base)

## Gitpod Setup

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/OurTechCommunity/catchup)

-   On clicking on the above 'Open in Gitpod' button, a Gitpod Workspace with all dependencies installed will open up.
-   Start the dev server by running `npm run start` in the root directory.
    -   A browser window with the web app should automatically open up, but if it doesn't, <kbd>ctrl + click</kbd> the link in the terminal to open up a window.
    -   NOTE: The server will have to be re-started manually to build the summary pages, as builds happen just once on starting the server.
-   A [GitHub integration](https://gitpod.io/integrations) will be required if not already done. Also, make sure to give appropriate permissions to GitHub on the [Integrations page](https://gitpod.io/integrations).
-   To open a PR
    -   Fork this repo. (Top right corner.)
    -   On Gitpod, [add the forked repo as a remote](https://harshkapadia2.github.io/git_basics/#_add_remote_repo_alias_remote_repo_url_git).
    -   [Make a new Git branch](https://harshkapadia2.github.io/git_basics/#_branch_name_2) on Gitpod.
    -   Make the required contribution(s) on Gitpod in the new branch.
        -   Please follow the [commit message format](https://harshkapadia2.github.io/git_basics/#_commit_messagetitle).
    -   [Push the new branch to the forked repo](https://harshkapadia2.github.io/git_basics/#_command_16).
    -   [Open a PR as usual](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions#submit-your-changes-for-review) from the forked repo.

## Local Setup

-   Fork this repo. (Top right corner.)
-   Clone the forked repo using the [`git clone`](https://harshkapadia2.github.io/git_basics/#_git_clone) command.
-   `cd` into the cloned repo directory.
-   Run `npm install` in the root directory of the project to install all dependencies.
-   [Install Asciidoctor.](https://asciidoctor.org/#installation)
-   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the contents of the [`sample.env` file](https://github.com/OurTechCommunity/catchup/blob/main/sample.env). The `sample.env` file has `placeholder_text` as variable values to prevent errors.
-   Run `npm run start` in the root directory of the project to build [the summary site](https://catchup.ourtech.community/summary) once and start a hot reload server. The web app should be accessible on `http://localhost:<port>`. (The port will appear in the server console.)
-   The summary site uses a Static Site Generator called [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org).
    -   Run the command `sh util/build.sh` in the root directory of the project to build [the summary site](https://catchup.ourtech.community/summary).
    -   The site should be accessible at `http://localhost:<port>/summary` or `http://localhost:<port>/summary/<summary_number>` after running `npm run start` in the root directory of the project. (The port will appear in the server console.)
        -   The `npm run start` builds the summary site just once, so for further Asciidoctor changes to reflect, the command will have to be run again.
-   Make contribution(s)

    -   Write meaningful commit messages and include the number (`#`) of the issue being resolved (if any) at the end of the commit message.

        Example: `:bug: fix: Resolve 'isCorrect' function error (#0 #2)`

        [Commit message format](https://harshkapadia2.github.io/git_basics/#_commit_messagetitle)

-   Open a Pull Request (PR).
    -   [Learn how to open a PR](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions).
    -   Solve one issue per PR, **without any extra changes**.
    -   **Include extra changes in a separate PR.**

## Git hooks & commit conventions

This repo uses [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) pre-commit hooks to enforce code quality and commit consistency. These hooks run automatically when you try to commit any changes.

### Pre-commit hook

1. Prettier formatting check:

    - Runs `prettier --check .` to ensure code is properly formatted.
    - Blocks the commit if issues are found.

2. Commit message check:
    - Ensures your commit message follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) spec.

### Running scripts manually

1. Prettier formatting check:

```bash
npm run lint:check
# OR
prettier --check .
```

2. Commit message check:

```bash
npm run commitlint "<commit message>"
# OR
commitlint --edit "<commit message>"
```

### Commit message format

Your commit message must follow the following format: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`

Examples of allowed commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add GitHub OAuth login" # correct
git commit -m "update: revise installation instructions" # correct
git commit -m "just an unconventional commit message" # incorrect
```

Allowed type values:

-   `build`
-   `chore`
-   `ci`
-   `docs`
-   `feat`
-   `fix`
-   `perf`
-   `refactor`
-   `revert`
-   `style`
-   `test`
-   `update`

> More types can be added by extending `rules['type-enum']` in `commitlint.config.js`

### Hooks setup

Hooks are automatically setup when you run:

```bash
npm install
```

This is handled by the `prepare` script in `package.json`:

```json
{
	"scripts": {
		"prepare": "node .husky/install.mjs"
	}
}
```

If you ever need to re-install `husky` manually:

```bash
npx husky install
```

### Skipping pre-commit hooks

To skip the hook (not recommended unless necessary), use:

```bash
git commit --no-verify
```

> Only use this if you have a specific reason. Bypassing the hook means formatting or commit message errors may go unnoticed.
