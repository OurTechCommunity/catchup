## Gitpod Setup

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/OurTechCommunity/catchup)

-   On clicking on the above 'Open in Gitpod' button, a Gitpod Workspace with all dependencies installed will open up.
-   Start the dev server by running `npm run start` in the root directory.
    -   A browser window with the web app should automatically open up, but if it doesn't, <kbd>ctrl + click</kbd> the link in the terminal to open up a window.
    -   NOTE: The server will have to be re-started manually to build the summary pages, as builds happen just once on starting the server.
-   A [GitHub integration](https://gitpod.io/integrations) will be required if not already done. Also, make sure to give appropriate permissions to GitHub on the [Integrations page](https://gitpod.io/integrations).
-   To open a PR
    -   Fork this repo. (Top right corner.)
    -   On Gitpod, [add the forked repo as a remote](https://harshkapadia2.github.io/git_basics/#_add_remote_repo_alias_remote_repo_url_git).
    -   [Make a new Git branch](https://harshkapadia2.github.io/git_basics/#_branch_name_2) on Gitpod.
    -   Make the required contribution(s) on Gitpod in the new branch.
        -   Please follow the [commit message format](https://harshkapadia2.github.io/git_basics/#_commit_messagetitle).
    -   [Push the new branch to the forked repo](https://harshkapadia2.github.io/git_basics/#_command_16).
    -   [Open a PR as usual](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions#submit-your-changes-for-review) from the forked repo.

## Local Setup

-   Fork this repo. (Top right corner.)
-   Clone the forked repo using the [`git clone`](https://harshkapadia2.github.io/git_basics/#_git_clone) command.
-   `cd` into the cloned repo directory.
-   Run `npm install` in the root directory of the project to install all dependencies.
-   [Install Asciidoctor.](https://asciidoctor.org/#installation)
-   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the contents of the [`sample.env` file](https://github.com/OurTechCommunity/catchup/blob/main/sample.env). The `sample.env` file has `placeholder_text` as variable values to prevent errors.
-   Run `npm run start` in the root directory of the project to build [the summary site](https://catchup.ourtech.community/summary) once and start a hot reload server. The web app should be accessible on `http://localhost:<port>`. (The port will appear in the server console.)
-   The summary site uses a Static Site Generator called [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org).
    -   Run the command `sh util/build.sh` in the root directory of the project to build [the summary site](https://catchup.ourtech.community/summary).
    -   The site should be accessible at `http://localhost:<port>/summary` or `http://localhost:<port>/summary/<summary_number>` after running `npm run start` in the root directory of the project. (The port will appear in the server console.)
        -   The `npm run start` builds the summary site just once, so for further Asciidoctor changes to reflect, the command will have to be run again.
-   Make contribution(s)

    -   Write meaningful commit messages and include the number (`#`) of the issue being resolved (if any) at the end of the commit message.

        Example: `:bug: fix: Resolve 'isCorrect' function error (#0 #2)`

        [Commit message format](https://harshkapadia2.github.io/git_basics/#_commit_messagetitle)

-   Open a Pull Request (PR).
    -   [Learn how to open a PR](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions).
    -   Solve one issue per PR, **without any extra changes**.
    -   **Include extra changes in a separate PR.**

## Contributing to the Summary Site

-   Fork and clone the CatchUp repository.
-   Create a new branch in your forked repository locally.
-   Navigate to the **summary/sessions** directory.
-   Create a new folder named after the summary number, then add the following files:
    -   `content.adoc`
    -   `attendees.adoc`
-   In the **/util** directory, follow the instructions in the README.
-   Run the following command to generate the initial attendee handle map (ensure Node.js is installed):
    ```
    node create-attendee-handle-map.js
    ```
-   Copy the attendee names into the `attendees.adoc` file.
-   Next, execute:
    ```
    node map-handles-to-catchup-attendees.js <sum_num>
    ```
-   Review the format used in previous summaries; copy and update it with the latest discussion details.
-   For adding links, use the format (example):
    ```
    link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcp2iFzHmfwd[Profiling^]
    ```
-   Rename the CatchUp screenshot to the corresponding meeting number and add it to the **/summary/static** folder.
-   Once your changes are complete, stage and push your modifications to your repository.
-   Finally, open a pull request on the OTC CatchUp repository.
